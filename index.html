                            <p><strong>In this project, we simulate an IoT based Smart-Home using
            ZigBee and WiFi in order to detect gas leakage detection in MATLAB's 3D environment, couple of papers are used to
            form this simulation project which is listed at the bottom of this post.
            In this project, we provide a multi-sensor system including heating and
            air conditioning sensors as well as an activation program for home users.
            In this system, when the gas leaks, the sensors installed in different parts
            of the simulation environment (home) will feel this problem and will start sending
             messages through the zigzag standard, and the windows will be opened for gas to escape.
            There is also a sensor-based intelligent network control system for energy control in this
            smart home (which is still under development). In the simulation output, we get the energy consumption
            in this smart home. The full details of the project will be uploaded to a YouTube tutorial video.

                            <p><strong>My M.Sc thesis aims to improve the energy consumption of heterogeneous IoT devices using an energy-aware clustering method. In a heterogeneous IoT cluster network, nodes (i.e., IoT devices) may have various energy profiles and energy sources.  One of the main challenges in the development and optimization of these types of clusters is battery-powered IoT devices, as they have limitations concerning their power consumption. This single constraint imposes several other constraints in regards to choices of routing protocols, Quality of Service (QoS), and mobility. In the past few years, many researchers, both in academia and industry, have proposed various methods for improving the energy efficiency of IoT networks. One of the well-known methods used to tackle this challenge is called the node clustering method. It involves grouping of nodes into several clusters and electing one or many cluster heads (CHs) for all the clusters. Several clustering algorithms proposed in the context of homogenous Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). However, due to the homogenous nature of nodes in such networks, most of these algorithms assumed that nodes had the same energy level and this is normally not true in IoT's diverse devices which in some cases we have nodes has been supplied with high capacity batteries or unlimited power. However, to utilize available clustering methods in the new paradigm of IoT networks, they need to be modified to consider the heterogeneity of nodes in IoT environments. In this work, we proposed a modification to an available clustering method, named Smart-BEEM, by redesigning the cluster head selection process. We introduced a statistical method that distributes energy consumption among highly energetic nodes and selects an appropriate communication medium to interact with other cluster heads. We evaluated our method using simulation and compared the results with well-known available clustering algorithms such as Smart-BEEM, BEEM, BEE, LEACH and HEED. On average, our proposed modification resulted in a 2% improvement in alive nodes, as well as a 3% improvement in residual energy among all the nodes in the network.

                            <p><strong>Nowadays, most major operating systems and computer networks,
      and even the Internet, which is the largest network in the world,
      use a protocol called the TCP / IP protocol. The limited bandwidth
      as well as the routing buffer limitations
      when network service requests increase, make network resources unresponsive,
      and if we don't have the right solution for network traffic management,
      the network becomes generally unstable. . These conditions increase the
      length of the queue formed in the routers, and this leads to an excessive
      delay in the arrival of packets to the destination, and may even cause no
      packets to reach their desired destination. These are just some of the
      goal setting shareware that you can use.
      Mostly in the field of control theory, the most important issue is sustainability
      as well as stabilization of dynamic systems, and considering the inherent ability
      and power of control science in the field of stabilization, the entry of this
       science into the field of traffic control in telecommunication networks is not unexpected.
      Since we can model telecommunications networks as a dynamic system, using control science
      in this area can solve many problems.
      So far, various methods have been proposed to prevent and control the phenomenon of overcrowding,
      most of which are well-known methods. The idea of using control theory concepts to solve the problem
      of overcrowding control has been around since the 1990s, and their goal is to use tools to analyze
      and design congestion controllers for networks in control engineering as There is a closed loop system.
      In general, to solve the problem of Internet congestion control with a systemic approach and also to
      use control theory, we will be able to consider the closed loop structure of the data transfer process
      in computer networks in such a way that a controller from the dynamic queue management family or Active
      queue management (AQM) is designed to be implemented in network routers, and the rest of the network is
      defined from the router's point of view, a control target system or plant. <a href="https://github.com/HamedMoasses/Dynamic-Behavior-Internet">Code</a>

        challenges I had in my M.Sc Thesis simulation project,
        I thought it would be the last time to use MATLAB for computer network simulation projects
      (specially IoT scenarios) and I thought migrating to an open source
      network simulator like NS3 would be much better since it makes me to
      gain new experience for future works specially for my PhD direction.
      since are under development by open source community and are free to use ! also after doing some research,
      I noticed NS3 is one of the best simulation tools for simulating IoT scenarios in 5G networks.
      I figured out MATLAB is a massive large and diverese language and tool for simulation and implementation. after study
      couple of papers (not too new and not too old!) I thought it would be a great excersie to warm up again
