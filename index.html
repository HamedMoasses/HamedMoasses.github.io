                <h2>About me,</h2>
                <h5>I received my BS.c and MS.c degree in 2016 and 2020 respectively all in Software Engineering at Islamic Azad University (IAU), Sanandaj Branch. Also I was a visiting student at Hochschule Hannover, Germany. I am honored to graduate within the top 15% among department's students, In parallel, I am working as Java-Backend & Android developer in the software industry, furthermore, I am a member of IEEE since 2017 and Young professional club. My Research interests are: Internet of Things - Fog computing -5G networks - Distributed systems - machine learning techniques as well as wireless communications. doing research, simulation and reading novel ideas in those areas are my passion. using clustering techniques to aim energy efficiency in IoT network was my M.Sc thesis project.</h5>

                            <p><strong>My Thesis was Improvement of Energy Consumption in IoT-Using Heterogeneous Clustering in Energy. One of the hot topics which observe the researcher's attention among various computer science fields is a new paradigm which named the Internet of Things. In this new type of network like the former wireless network generations e.g. wireless sensor networks, various challenges e.g. network lifetime, routing protocol optimization, network topology optimization, and security remains the same, and researchers are still working on this issues. In this type of network, most of the devices are battery-powered devices and they have limitations regarding power. By taking this issue into account, the development and optimization of this type of network are facing many challenges and limitations in terms of routing protocols and Quality of Service. Currently, so many methods and ideas are proposed for energy efficiency. One of the methods is clustering and choosing an efficient cluster head to transfer data which is a method to aim green computing. Many algorithms are proposed for clustering so far, but due to the heterogeneity of nodes' energy in the network, some nodes may have limited power and some may have highly energetic or unlimited power. This issue is caused that clustering methods proposed for homogeneous networks e.g. wireless sensors need to be modified to works in IoT Environment inefficient way. In this work the cluster head selection system is modified using the statistical method and distributes energy consumption among highly energetic nodes, also selecting an appropriate communication protocol to interact with other cluster heads and finally transferring data to the cloud are aimed. Simulation results indicate a 2% improvement in alive nodes and a 3% improvement in residual energy among nodes in the network. also iteration number which is an overload for the network is reduced.
